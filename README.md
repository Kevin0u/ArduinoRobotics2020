### Reflection:
Today, I started playing with the arduino. I tried connecting it with my computer and ran some testcodes to make the arduino blink. I played with a arduino uno. I connected a DC motor to the arduino. I verified that the motor was able to run.

### Reflection:
Today, I realized that in order to make my motor run properly, I need a motor controller.

## 6.22.2020
### Reflection:
Today, my motor controller and other parts arrived. I now have LED's, LCD displays, Piezo Speakers, wires, a servo motor, and 2 geared DC motors.

## 7.2.2020
### Reflection: 
Today, I learned to connect my uno to a breadboard with a potentiometer. Using the potentiometer, I was able to control the servo and have it spin. I also learned today that based on the spin from the potentiometer, the analog number (which ranges from 0-1023) updates to the servo each time a change was made. The goal for me is to learn how to incorporate hardware with software and hopefully build a mini robot in the near future. This part is important because I need to understand how potentiometer and servo motors work and how they tie in together with a robot.
