Today, I learned to connect my uno to a breadboard with a potentiometer. Using the potentiometer, I was able to control the servo and have it spin. I also learned today that based on the spin from the potentiometer, the analog number (which ranges from 0-1023) updates to the servo each time a change was made. The goal for me is to learn how to incorporate hardware with software and hopefully build a mini robot in the near future. This part is important because I need to understand how potentiometer and servo motors work and how they tie in together with a robot.
